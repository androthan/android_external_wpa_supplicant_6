WPA Supplicant 6.x for devices with prebuilt WiFi binaries

This is the latest source code for the WPA supplicant 6.x for CyanogenMod 10.1 (Android 4.2.x), optimized
for CyanogenMod 11 (Android 4.4.x).
This will only build the shared libraries "libwpa_cli.so" and "libwpa_client.so".
The 'wpa_supplicant" won't be built (it's prebuilt).
This isn't officially supported by the AOSP or The CyanogenMod Project.

1. Open <android-source>/.repo/manifest.xml
2. Add the following line:
   <project name="androthan/android_external_wpa_supplicant_6" path="external/external_wpa_supplicant_6" remote="github" revision="cm-11.0" />
3. Run command: repo sync

Enable it in BoardConfig.mk in you device tree (device/*/*)

Source code files have been moved around in v0.6.x releases and
compared to earlier releases, the programs are now build by first
going to a subdirectory (wpa_supplicant or hostapd) and creating
build configuration (.config) and running 'make' there (for
Linux/BSD/cygwin builds).
